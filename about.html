                <b>F</b>irst of all, I would like to give my thanks to everyone
                who has payed interest in my personal page.<br><br>
                <b>M</b>y name is Do Quoc Thinh. I am currently a Computer Science
                student from the International University - National University
                of Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. This is my first project in the
                course Web Application Development, a personal web page. It
                demonstrates everything about myself along with some projects
                and activities I have participated until now.<br><br>
                <b>I</b> know that there are still lots of mistakes and missing
                parts which I cannot implement for now, but I am trying my best
                to improve it. In the near future, I will make it become one of
                the fanciest page ever (^.^).<br><br>
                <b>H</b>ope you guys enjoy it and, wish all of you have a nice day !!!
